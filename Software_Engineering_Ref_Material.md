Once you actually start writing your own programs you must learn Git, this is more or less the de facto method that most companies use to maintain version control of software.

Highly Recommend, if you have the time.  This is the live actual Harvard Intro to computer science class and it is FREE.  You are actually taking the class and watching the live streamed lectures, you have homework and projects, and access to the actual Harvard TAs.  What really makes the course is the instructor though, David Malan, top notch CS professor.  This a well known and well regarded into to CS.  When I took the class it was based around the C programming language, it is now based around Python, which is much more relevant to modern programming. Recommend.

Part 1 of Googleâ€™s Python class, highly recommended to me by my Python guru that I work with now, I plan on starting this this weekend.  Looks really, solid fundamentals, interactive with materials, but you can take at your own pace. This is part one, but the intention is to take the entire class, which can be done in 1-3 days.

Great interactive online learning resource for most of the major languages in modern software.  I use this to get my feet wet in various languages.

Good resource to actually start practice algorithms and various concepts.  Many companies use this platform for testing in the interview process.  It is nice because it has "tracks" that allow you to hone and develop skills around various core CS concepts.  I like the interface and the ability to focus the challenges on specific skill sets.  There is even a track centered around Cracking the Coding Interview, which I have listed below.

A fun "Game-ified" code challenge website, also the base of another platform that companies are starting to use for interview testing, good to be familiar with.

Intro to schema/lisp, although you will most likely not use this language itself in a profession sense, due to the language design, it is one of the most helpful thing to learn to wrap your head around **Recursion. ** A very important concept to master throughout all software engineering.

The computer science bible, very dense, I have not finished yet, also based around Lisp.  A staple of most well regarded computer science degree programs, very helpful for creating a solid base.

A great intro Javascript, mainly centered around the ES5 variant of JavaScript, very helpful if you plan on doing any frontend / web based work.
